# TW-Chat-Bot
## Description
This has been a small project I've been working on during the last two years of my career within The-West. This is supposed to be a chat bot that replies on your and others' custom commands, that usually start with an exclamation mark. The bot includes a raffle system and a voting system.
Please be aware that "bots" are apparently forbidden in game and this script might get you banned. I only used it as a game mod, on the beta-testing server.
### Support
As of August of 2017 I am no longer in charge of updating the script. If you want to be in charge of it feel free to make a pull request and I will approve it as soon as I'm available.
